## End2End Tests

**Note: After completing every task you can run**

```cmd
npm run test:task -- task00

# Example
npm run test:task -- task01
```
this command will run e2e test suit responsible for testing this part of the assignment. For everything to run smoothly you need to do the tasks in order. This should check correctness of every individual task, if the tests are failing but you are sure that the task is completed don't hesitate to ignore them. We check every manual check every solution.

> You can access GraphQL sandbox navigating to: http://localhost:4000

**Request:**

Apollo client is already setup, so you can jump straight in to writing `useQuery` hook.

**Types:**

Types for the GraphQL response can be found in [./frontend/src/types/graphql.ts](./frontend/src/types/graphql.ts)

**Example response:**


```json
{
  "data": {

**2.**
- [ ] Display loading skeleton while waiting for the response from the server. This can be achieved using `isLoading` prop from [`Card`](./frontend/src/ui/Card.tsx) component.

---

**3.**
- [ ] Ensure that the search input (which can be found in [`App`](./frontend/src/App.tsx) component), is focused when the page is reloaded.

---

**4.**
- [ ] Add the ability to select and deselect "mood cards" using the `isSelected` and `onSelect` props of the [`Card`](./frontend/src/ui/Card.tsx) component. "Mood card" can be selected by clicking on the dot in the top right corner.

---

**5.**
- [ ] Limit the number of possible mood selections to 3. 

--- 

**6.**
- [ ] Limit the number of displayed mood cards to 3. You can achieve this by calling the API with appropriate variables:

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Add query parameter to url `limit=3`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Add query variable `{"limit": 3}`.
</details>

---

**7.**
- [ ] Implement pagination functionality. The [`Navigation`](./frontend/src/ui/Navigation.tsx) component should have two optional props: `onNext` and `onPrevious`. Add appropriate handles to alow user to: 

  - [ ] By clicking "Next" display 3 next moods from API (increase the `limit` by 3 and `skip` by 3)

  - [ ] By clicking "Previous" display 3 previous moods from API (decrease `limit` by 3 and `skip` by 3)

Example: 


**For page 1:**
limit = 3 and skip = 0


**For page 2:**
limit = 6 and skip = 3

and so on.

> The selection state should remain unaffected by navigation.

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Extend query variables by adding `&skip=3`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Extend query variables by adding `{"skip": 3}`.
</details>

---

**8.**
- [ ] Disable navigation button when waiting for the response from the backed server, this can be achieved using the `isNextDisabled` and `isPreviousDisabled` props from [`Navigation`](./frontend/src/ui/Navigation.tsx) component. 

---

**9.**
- [ ] Add search functionality. Without impacting the previous functionality. When user types something into the search input, we should make an API call and display the results accordingly.


<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Request variables should be set to `?limit=3&search="<search_query>"`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Query variables should be set to `{"limit": 3, "search": "<search_query>"}"`
</details>

---

**10.**
- [ ] Debounce the search input. Request shouldn't be send as long as the user is typing.

---

**11.**
- [ ] Display [`NoResults`](./frontend/src/ui/NoResults.tsx) component from [`ui`](./frontend/src/ui) when no results are found for a given query

---

**12.**
- [ ] Display additional information about given mood. This can be achieved by editing existing [`Mood`](./frontend/src/components/Mood.tsx) component. Use `moodId` provided from query params to fetch the data from appropriate endpoint, then to display retrieved information utilize [`Details`](./frontend/src/ui/Details.tsx) component from [`/ui`](./frontend/src/ui) folder. **Please make sure that user can click on the multiple mood cards while data is loading but only one state updated will be performed**

## Unit Tests


- [ ] Add unit tests. You can find some examples in the [`Mood.spec.tsx`](./frontend/src/components/Mood.spec.tsx) and [`Moods.spec.tsx`](./frontend/src/components/Moods.spec.tsx) files. The setup for the [msw](https://mswjs.io/) can be found in [`setup-tests.ts`](./frontend/setup-tests.ts). Once again if you prefer can change the unit tests setup, matchers and runners, this one is configured to run with [`@testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/) and [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/)

You can run unit-tests via this command:
```cmd
npm run test
```
