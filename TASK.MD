---

- [ ] Ensure that the search input (which can be found in [`App`](./src/App.tsx) component), is focused when the page is reloaded.

---

- [ ] Add the ability to select and deselect "mood cards" using the `isSelected` and `onSelect` props of the [`Card`](./src/ui/Card.tsx) component. "Mood card" can be selected by clicking on the dot in the top right corner.

---

- [ ] Limit the number of possible mood selections to 3. 

--- 

- [ ] Limit the number of displayed mood cards to 3. You can achieve this by calling the API with appropriate variables:

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Add query parameter to url `limit=3`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Add query variable `{"limit": 3}`.
</details>

---

- [ ] Implement pagination functionality. The [`Navigation`](./src/ui/Navigation.tsx) component should have two optional props: `onNext` and `onPrevious`. Add appropriate handles to alow user to: 

  - [ ] By clicking "Next" display 3 next moods from API (increase the `limit` by 3 and `skip` by 3)

  - [ ] By clicking "Previous" display 3 previous moods from API (decrease `limit` by 3 and `skip` by 3)

Example: 


**For page 1:**
limit = 3 and skip = 0


**For page 2:**
limit = 6 and skip = 3

and so on.

> The selection state should remain unaffected by navigation.

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Extend query variables by adding `&skip=3`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Extend query variables by adding `{"skip": 3}`.
</details>

---

- [ ] Add search functionality. Without impacting the previous functionality. When user types something into the search input, we should make an API call and display the results accordingly.


<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Request variables should be set to `?limit=3&search="<search_query>"`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Query variables should be set to `{"limit": 3, "search": "<search_query>"}"`
</details>

---

- [ ] Display [`NoResults`](./src/ui/NoResults.tsx) component from [`ui`](./src/ui) when no results are found for a given query

---

### Bonus
---

- [ ] Display additional information about given mood. This can be achieved by editing existing [`Mood`](./src/components/Mood.tsx) component. Use `moodId` provided from query params to fetch the data from appropriate endpoint, then to display retrieved information utilize [`Details`](./src/ui/Details.tsx) component from [`/ui`](./src/ui) folder. **Please make sure that user can click on the multiple mood cards while data is loading but only one state updated will be performed**

- [ ] Implement the functionality to send selected "moods" to our API. Utilize the `onSend` prop from the [`CTA`](./src/ui/CTA.tsx) component in the [`App`](./src/App.tsx) component.

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Send _POST_ request to http://localhost:4000/api/moods/current with `{body: { moodIds: [<ids>] }}`.

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Send mutation with selected moods ids `saveCurrentMoods(moodsIds: [ID!]!)`.
</details>

---

- [ ] Display number of all moods. This can be achieved by passing the `count` data from the request to the [`Navigation`](./src/ui/Navigation.tsx) component as a prop.

---

- [ ] Disable navigation buttons when user reaches the first and the last page, this can be achieved using `isPreviousDisabled` and `isNextDisabled` from [`Navigation`](./src/ui/Navigation.tsx) component.
